    Current status: Functional. Made necessary changes to call upon 'output' function in 'ball_output.cc' (i.e. declaring type of variable when passing argument 't' was not done prior). Made necessary changes to 'ball_util' (i.e. changed time_step function and now uses operator() as error was being produced with the initial manner it was coded) and also changed the manner in which variables were assigned (i.e. changed ball::init_ball to ball::ball as error was being produced with initial nmanner it was coded). Made necessary changes to main to remove all errors (i.e. proper declarations of variables etc). Assignment 4 now complete. Formatting and commenting necessary, however, and will be done next.

    Current status: Nonfunctional. Created 'ball_util.cc' which holds the class ball and its member definitions, created 'ball_output.cc' which outputs the time and state vector to user as a space seperated entries with each line associated to one time point, and created header files for each.
