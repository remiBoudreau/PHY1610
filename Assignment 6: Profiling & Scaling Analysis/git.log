    Nevermind. One more additional python script added 'curve_fit_serial_fraction.py' which fits the speed up points as a function of number of cores by the function S = 1/(f + (1 - f)/p).

    'clearingtimeresults.log' (rather than clearingtime.log as specified in previous git commit) was created by runing 'clearingtimeloop.sh'. It contains all the wall times and the number of cores as a header for each wall time. Furthermore, this log file was copied to my local machine and analyzed using a created matlab script, named 'Analysis.m'. The results of the matlab script are a plot of the speed up against the number of processors which is given in 'speedUpAgainstNumberofProcessors.png' and a plain text file named 'results.txt' which details the number of processors, elapsed wall time and speed up in seperate columns with each row corresponding to a different trial. Lastly, the mean serial fraction was also calculated with the 'Analysis.m' script and was found to be 0.0192. This is written to the last line of results.txt for convenience. Cheers. Assignment 5.6 completed. F@#$

    clearingtimeloop.sh created. It runs 'time' command with ./clearingtime.sh using 1-8 cores sequentially and writes the output to clearingtime.log plain text file.

    make command used with flags added. Produced gmon.out. 'time' command used on ants executable. Results written to time.log. 'gprof' command used with 'ants' binary with 'gmon.out' as an arguments and the output written to gprof.log.
